# Bilateralstimulation.io Coding Challenge | Save & Retrieve Configurations

This was a test given to me by Bileteralstimulation.io, and done as a live coding excersize within 1 hours. I sucessfully implemented most of the requirements :D

## Context

Therapists use our tool to provide bilateral stimulation (BLS) online.
The most popular form of BLS is visual BLS, where the patient follows a "trigger" on the screen with their eyes from left to right.
The therapist can configure the appearance and behavior of said trigger (e.g. color and shape).

## The task

We want to provide therapists with an interface where they can _configure_ the visual trigger and then _save and retrieve_ their configuration.

## Requirements

As a therapist:

1. I visit the page and see a preview of the visual trigger (trigger color, background color, trigger shape)
2. I can choose the trigger color, the background color, and the trigger shape (round or square)
3. I can save a given configuration
4. I can see a list of saved configurations
5. Bonus I: The list of saved configurations persists when I refresh the page
6. Bonus II: I can load a saved configuration

## Out of scope

- We don't need to actually animate the trigger
- We can disregard any of the other configurable parameters of our real-world tool (e.g. trigger path and speed). It's just about background color, trigger color, and trigger shape.
- We can disregard responsiveness (desktop-only is fine)

## Tips
- **Make tradeoffs:** This challenge is timeboxed to **one hour**. This can be tight, so focus on what you think is important.
- **Think out loud** so I can follow your thought process
- **Ask questions** if you need context or clarification
- **Feel free to use Google** to look up APIs, syntax, etc.
